### Why to use Scratch build over CRA

CRA is very easy for all the React developers, but in CRA presence of files and unnecessary lines of code that we don't need and most of them we don't understand. It's always to good start React Application from scratch.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
